# Stochastic Laplacian Heaviside Projection Code

## Description

In lattice QCD the continuum rotation symmetry is broken to a discrete group.
The SU(2) irreducible representation denoting spin is thus subduced into a 
discrete sum of irreducible representations of the rotations leaving a 
hypercubic lattice invariant.
